# Traffic-Light-Synchronization-Optimization-

this is my graduation project, its about how to optimize the traffic light optimization using distributed model with GA.


# Intrduction 

In our big world, the number of vehicales increased in crazy way, so the need to system that can manage the traffic light signals come on demand to the big cities. 

In our project we will build such system, that can reduce traffic light timing so the number of vehicals on road will decrease. By helping of the powerfull of Genetic Algorithm in problems like this, and by build a distributed model to handle the huge number of nodes in traffic network in efficient way using Hadoop and Island model, we will create a system that can create the best timing schedule for part from network to test the result, ou featue goal is making large-scale and real-time system for the hole traffic network.
